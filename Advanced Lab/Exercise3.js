// 3. 'Debouncing' is a concept that refers to 'putting off' the execution of multiple, fast-timed,
// similar requests until there's a brief pause, then only executing the most recent of those
// requests. See https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/debouncing
// It's often used to handle fast-firing scrolling events in a browser, or to prevent multiple server
// requests being initiated if a user clicks repeatedly on a button.
// Using the following code to test and start with:
// a) Create a debounce(func) decorator, which is a wrapper that takes a function func and
// suspends calls to func until there's 1000 milliseconds of inactivity. After this 1 second
// pause, the most recent call to func should be executed and any others ignored.
// b) Extend the debounce decorator function to take a second argument ms, which defines the
// length of the period of inactivity instead of hardcoding to 1000ms
// c) Extend debounce to allow the original debounced function printMe to take an argument
// msg which is included in the console.log statement.

function printMe() {
console.log('printing debounced message')
}
printMe = debounce(printMe); //create this debounce function for a)
//fire off 3 calls to printMe within 300ms - only the LAST one should print, after
1000ms of no calls
setTimeout( printMe, 100);
setTimeout( printMe, 200);
setTimeout( printMe, 300);
