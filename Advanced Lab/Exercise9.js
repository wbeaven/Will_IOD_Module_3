// 9. We can delay execution of a function using setTimeout, where we need to provide both
// the callback function and the delay after which it should execute.
// a) Create a promise-based alternative randomDelay() that delays execution for a
// random amount of time (between 1 and 20 seconds) and returns a promise we can use
// via .then(), as in the starter code below
// b) If the random delay is even, consider this a successful delay and resolve the promise,
// and if the random number is odd, consider this a failure and reject it
// c) Update the testing code to catch rejected promises and print a different message
// d) Try to update the then and catch messages to include the random delay value

function randomDelay() {
  // your code
}
randomDelay().then(() => console.log("There appears to have been a delay."));
